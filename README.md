# 📱 E-Scrap Collector (Scrap Merchant App)

## 🌍 Introduction
In Pakistan, traditional scrap collection is inefficient and disruptive — local collectors roam streets, consuming fuel, time, and creating noise pollution. The **E-Scrap Collector App** digitalizes this process by connecting citizens with scrap collectors through a mobile platform.  

This Android-based app allows users to sell scrap online at **market-standard rates**, while collectors save time and resources by only visiting households that actually want to sell. It’s the **first digital scrap collection solution in Pakistan**, designed to reduce noise, fuel usage, and support sustainable recycling.
